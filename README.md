# MSA_TIPS

Running readTIPS.r will generate readTIPS.

readTIPS function:
  input: a list of words
  output: a datatable with a frequency of each word appeared in the tips from 2011 to 2018.

Usage example:
    data_frame_name <- readTIPS(c("word1", "word2", ...))
    
IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH USING GIT BEFORE...
1. It is always good to have git to share the code and modify together. (any kind of code would work!)
2. There is a github desktop version if you want to prefer graphic user interface.

3. click "clone or download."
   - if you don't have the desktop version download ZIP.
   - if you have the desktop version "Open in Desktop" and specify your working directory
   - if you prefer terminal copy the url and you should already know what to do

4. Copy and paste "Tips Project 2019 - Blue Team 9.xlsx" to the working directory (where the readTIPS.r is)

5. run the readTIPS.r

6. If it complains anything about uninstalled packages, install the packages. They are very commonly used in r anyway.
